Life here is exciting, the place, people, office that I am working on, its just one thing that is missing, my **family** and friends. Anyway, we all know that one can never have it all at one, its almost impossible. We always have to **sacrifice** something in order to achieve something else. 

Life is like this, you get one thing, but you have to return something else back.
